**ENUM**

# `TemplateSpec.Mode`

```swift
public enum Mode: AutoCodable
```

> The mode that declares how a template is used

## Cases
### `module(filter:)`

```swift
case module(filter: RegularExpression = Self.defaultFilter)
```

> The module mode. In this mode the associated template will be executed once per
> each one of the declared first party modules. The generated file
> will be placed inside the directory containing the module. Also, it is possible
> to access the information of the module by using the `module` key that will become
> available in the context. Optionally you can pass a regex filter to select which of the
> modules to be used when rendering the template

### `moduleToRoot(filter:)`

```swift
case moduleToRoot(filter: RegularExpression = Self.defaultFilter)
```

> The moduleToRoot mode. In this mode the associated template will be executed once per
> each one of the declared first party modules. The generated file
> will be placed at the root of the repository. Thus, it is important that each generated file
> has a different name, or otherwise they will be overwritten. Also, it is possible
> to access the information of the module by using the `module` key that will become
> available in the context. Optionally you can pass a regex filter to select which of the
> modules to be used when rendering the template

### `root`

```swift
case root
```

> The root mode. In this mode the associated template will be executed only once.
> The generated file will be placed at the root of the repository.
