# Force bazel output to use colors (good for jenkins) and print useful errors
# This is disabled as messes up with the errors and warnings shown by xcode:
# they contain color characters, and when clicked do not take you to the offending line
# common --color=yes

# Needed for building and testing
build --apple_platform_type=ios

# Build the app FAT, so it can be run on devices. This requires a provisioning profile
# build --ios_multi_cpus=armv7,arm64

# I do not think this is needed
# build --xcode_version=10.3

# During development
# build -s --test_output=all --cache_test_results=no
